## Installation

Install dependencies to get started.

## Development

Start a web server and open your app in your browser. When you make changes in the `src` folder, it will rebuild your app and refresh your browser.

```sh
npm run develop
```

Lint your code and automatically fix lint errors with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for JS and with [stylefmt](https://github.com/morishitter/stylefmt) for CSS where possible.

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

Create production build in the `build` folder. You can deploy this folder to wherever you want.

```sh
npm run build
```
