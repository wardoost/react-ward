```

Lint your code and automatically fix lint errors with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for JS and with [stylefmt](https://github.com/morishitter/stylefmt) for CSS where possible.

```sh
npm run lint
```

Starts a static file server with [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) with the `build` folder as root.

```sh
npm start
```

## Testing

Run all tests and watch for file changes to restart the tests.

```sh
npm run test
```

Create and open the coverage report of all your tests.

```sh
npm run coverage
```

## Deployment

Create production build in the `build` folder. You can deploy this folder to wherever you want.

```sh
npm run build
```
